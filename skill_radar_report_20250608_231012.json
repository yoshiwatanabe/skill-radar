This machine has been great for learning to fine-tune LLMs and produce synthetic data-sets.  However, even with deepspeed and 8B models, the maximum training  full fine-tune context length was about 2560 tokens per conversation.  Finally I decided to get some 16-\u0026gt;8x8 lane splitters, some more GPUs and some more RAM.   Training  Qwen/Qwen3-8B (full fine-tune) with 4K context length completed success fully and without pci errors, and I am happy with the build.  The spec is like:\n\n* Asrock Rack EP2C622D16-2T\n* 8xRTX 3090 FE (192 GB VRAM total)\n* Dual Intel Xeon 8175M\n* 512 GB DDR4 2400\n* EZDIY-FAB PCIE Riser cables\n* Unbranded Alixpress PCIe-Bifurcation 16X to x8x8 \n* Unbranded Alixpress open chassis\n\nAs the lanes are now split, each GPU has about half the bandwidth.  Even if training takes a bit longer, being able to full fine tune to a longer context window is worth it in my opinion.\n\n\n\n ",

          "summary": "Hi, I am sharing my second iteration of a \u0022ollama-like\u0022 tool, which is targeted at people like me and many others who like running the llama-server directly. This time I am building on the creation of llama-swap and llama.cpp, making it truly distributed and open source. It started with [this](https://github.com/R-Dson/llama-server-cli.py/tree/main) tool, which worked okay-ish. However, after looking at llama-swap I thought it accomplished a lot of similar things, but it could become something more, so I started a discussion [here](https://github.com/mostlygeek/llama-swap/issues/153) which was very useful and a lot of great points were brought up. After that I started this project instead, which manages all config files, model files and gguf files easily in the terminal.\n\nIntroducing [llamate](https://github.com/R-Dson/llamate) (llama\u002Bmate), a simple \u0022ollama-like\u0022 tool for managing and running GGUF language models from your terminal. It supports the typical API endpoints and ollama specific endpoints. If you know how to run ollama, you can most likely drop in replace this tool. Just make sure you got the drivers installed to run llama.cpp\u0027s llama-server. Currently, it only support Linux and Nvidia/CUDA by default. If you can compile llama-server for your own hardware, then you can simply replace the llama-server file.\n\nCurrently it works like this, I have set up two additional repos that the tool uses to manage the binaries:\n\n* [R-Dson/llama-server-compile](https://github.com/R-Dson/llama-server-compile) is used to daily compile the CUDA version of llama-server.\n* [R-Dson/llama-swap](https://github.com/R-Dson/llama-swap) is used to compile the llama-swap file with patches for ollama endpoint support.\n\nThese compiled binaries are used to run llama-swap and llama-server. This still need some testing and there will probably be bugs, but from my testing it seems to work fine so far.\n\nTo get start, it can be downloaded using:\n\n    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R-Dson/llamate/main/install.sh | bash\n\nFeel free to read through the file first (as you should before running any script).\n\nAnd the tool can be simply used like this:\n\n    # Init the tool to download the binaries\n    llamate init\n    \n    # Add and download a model\n    llamate add llama3:8b\n    llamate pull llama3:8b\n    \n    # To start llama-swap with your models automatically configured\n    llamate serve\n\nYou can checkout [this](https://github.com/R-Dson/llamate/blob/main/llamate/data/model_aliases.py) file for more aliases or checkout the repo for instructions of how to add a model from huggingface directly. I hope this tool will help with easily running models locally for your all!\n\nLeave a comment or open an issue to start a discussion or leave feedback.\n\nThanks for checking it out!",

      "summary": "I understand that this topic comes up daily and that there is a lot of speculation and opinions. This sub is understandably more inclined to believe AGI and/or ASI is coming soon than other subs. I might use some technical terms wrong or the words AI or LLM too losely at times, but I believe I get my thoughts across anyways.\n\nI am also one who believes in AI and its potential, but I am no expert.  I guess what I am trying to seek is a reasonable view, amongst all the noise and hype, and I turn to this sub as I know that there are a lot of experts and very knowledgeable people here. I know that no one working at OpenAI, Google Deepmind, Anthropic etc is gonna break an NDA and give us a full rundown of the current state.  But my questions are: What\u0027s actually the deal? What are we really looking at?\n\nAlthough AI is here to stay and it might completely take over. There are a couple of options that I see.\n\n1. It\u0027s overhyped. This brings hype, investments, money. No company want to get left behind, and more investments are good for the companies regardless.\n\n2. It\u0027s real. This justifies the hype, investements and money. The top companies and governments are scrambling to become first and number one.\n\n3. It\u0027s reached it\u0027s top for the foreseeable future. The available models for the public are already revolutionary as they are and are already changing the landscape of science, tech and society.\n\nAlso from my understanding there are 2 bottlenecks. Data and Compute. (I wanted to insert a - so much between these two sentences, but I will not for understandable reasons lol.)\n\nThe models are already trained on all the high quality information that is available, that is most of human made data ever produced. Some of the quality data that is untapped:\n\nPeoples personal photo libraries.\n\nSmart watches and biometric data.\n\nLive video and gps from personal phones.\n\nBoth the vast amounts of data points and the possibility of a real time global view of the world. If all this is avaialable and possible to process in real time then we have future prediction machine on our hands.\n\nAnd the problem as the internet gets filled with more and more AI-content the models train on other AI-generated data and it becomes a negative feedback loop.\n\nAs for data, 100s of billions of dollars are invested into energy production and use for AI. There might be some point of energy that is needed to overcome the bump. \n\nThere might also be an energy/computation treshold. Lowering energy usage through better algorithms and having more compute available. I like to compare it to the Great filter theory in the Fermi Paradox. There is a certain point here that needs to be overcome. Maybe it\u0027s hypothesis or an actual mathematical/physical treshold that needs to be reached. What is it?\n\nThe potential third I can think of is the Architecture of the AI or LLM. How it is constructed programatically. Maybe it is here something needs to change to bring forth the next \u0022jump\u0022 in capabilites.\n\nI am also trying to prepare for the future and become as competent as possible. I know if ASI comes there\u0027s not that much you can do as a single individual. I am wondering whether I should become an AI-engineer, 5 year degree with a masters. Not to neccessarily become a researcher or work at the biggest tech companies. But to integrate AI and machine learning into processes, logistics and business systems. Would this still be a smart move in 2025, or is it too late?",

      "summary": "About 1 year ago I posted about a [4 x 3090 build](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bqxfc0/another_4x3090_build/).  This machine has been great for learning to fine-tune LLMs and produce synthetic data-sets.  However, even with deepspeed and 8B models, the maximum training  full fine-tune context length was about 2560 tokens per conversation.  Finally I decided to get some 16-\u0026gt;8x8 lane splitters, some more GPUs and some more RAM.   Training  Qwen/Qwen3-8B (full fine-tune) with 4K context length completed success fully and without pci errors, and I am happy with the build.  The spec is like:\n\n* Asrock Rack EP2C622D16-2T\n* 8xRTX 3090 FE (192 GB VRAM total)\n* Dual Intel Xeon 8175M\n* 512 GB DDR4 2400\n* EZDIY-FAB PCIE Riser cables\n* Unbranded Alixpress PCIe-Bifurcation 16X to x8x8 \n* Unbranded Alixpress open chassis\n\nAs the lanes are now split, each GPU has about half the bandwidth.  Even if training takes a bit longer, being able to full fine tune to a longer context window is worth it in my opinion.\n\n\n\n ",

Here they appear to learn a mathematical field within minutes, create toy problems to practice the solution, and then offer novel solutions that are checked and validated by mathematicians.",
