### 2. [Life before ci/cd](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1l6djk5/life_before_cicd/)
**Source:** Reddit-devops | **Relevance:** 75%

Hello,

Can anyone explain how life was before ci/cd pipeline. 

I understand developers and operations team were so separate. 

So how the DevOps culture now make things faster!? Is it like developer doesn’t need to depend on operations team to deploy his application ? And operations team focus on SRE ? Is my understanding correct ?

### 3. [DevOps Isn’t Just Pipelines—It’s Creating Environments Where Quality Can Emerge](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1l69g0j/devops_isnt_just_pipelinesits_creating/)
**Source:** Reddit-devops | **Relevance:** 73%

In the DevOps world, we champion automation, CI/CD, and fast delivery. But what about the organizational conditions that make true quality sustainable?

My new post looks at the resistance to quality practices (tests, simple design, pair programming) and how it's often tied to:

* Short-term delivery pressure
* Team-level silos and lack of alignment
* Poor feedback loops

We need more than tools—we need cultures that enable trust, learning, and shared ownership.

How are you addressing the “people and incentives” side of quality in your DevOps practices?

### 4. [I built a C# Deep Research Meta Agent](https://i.redd.it/hmmc792obp5f1.png)
**Source:** Reddit-dotnet | **Relevance:** 73%

just wanted to share something I worked on a recenlty that might help someone here especially if you’re interested in building AI agents using .NET and C#.

I recently entered the **Microsoft AI Agents Hackathon 2025**, and my project **Apollo** ended up winning **Best C# Agent**!

Its basically a similiar to most deep research implementations but its fully *'agentic'*

* Plans a multi-step information retrieval strategy
* Scrapes live web content (via [EXA.ai](http://exa.ai/) )
* Embeds + stores data in `pgvector` on Neon
* Synthesizes a detailed report using GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro
* All built with **Semantic Kernel**, **Kernel Memory**, and **.NET 9**

Built in just under 30 days, definately not the cleanest architecture,but I did my best to keep it readable and modular. There’s definitely a lot of room for improvement especially around memory management and dynamic agent behavior, but I hope it’s useful as a reference for anyone trying to build practical agent workflows in C#.

### 6. [Best way to send 2M individual API requests from MSSQL records?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1l6d7w5/best_way_to_send_2m_individual_api_requests_from/)
**Source:** Reddit-dotnet | **Relevance:** 69%

There are 2 million records in an MSSQL database. For each of these records, I need to convert the table columns into JSON and send them as the body of an individual request to the client's API — meaning one API request per record.

What would be the most efficient and reliable way to handle this kind of bulk operation?

Also, considering the options of Python and C#, which language would be more suitable for this task in terms of performance and ease of implementation?

### 9. [What finally made Python click for me in the cloud world: automation](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1l6j6a3/what_finally_made_python_click_for_me_in_the/)
**Source:** Reddit-devops | **Relevance:** 61%

I used to think I needed to master Python before I could do anything useful with it.  
Turns out, just learning how to automate basic cloud tasks completely changed the game.

There were small wins, but they gave Python a real-world purpose beyond just “learning syntax.”

I’m still figuring it all out, but the shift from theory to doing things with Python in a cloud setting really boosted my confidence.

Anyone else using Python this way for cloud or DevOps stuff?  
Would love to hear your favorite use cases or beginner-friendly wins.

Now I only see these logging  in my terminal when I press "build" button. But If I use Azure or then Do I need to change anything?
